## Feature-packs

Feature-pack represents a released unit of software that can be installed or uninstalled using the provisioning tool. Feature-packs are Maven artifacts identified by GAV (groupId, artifactId and version).

Feature-pack contains:

* metadata describing

** dependencies on other featurepacks;

** the default configuration(s) of the distribution;

** the default package set that should be installed;

* _(optional)_ a set of content packages;

* _(optional)_ a set of configuration features;

* _(optional)_ various resources required to properly assemble and setup the installation;

* _(optional)_ custom provisioning plug-ins.


Feature-pack may declare dependencies on other feature-packs. Before a feature-pack is installed the tool will make sure its dependencies are satisifed (installing the missing ones).

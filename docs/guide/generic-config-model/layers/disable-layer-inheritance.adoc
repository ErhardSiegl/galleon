#### Disabling inheritance of layers

If at some point it is necessary to reset the configuration in terms of layers it consists of and possibly re-define the configuration explicitly, it can be done like this

[source,xml]
----
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:2.0">
    <feature-pack location="prod1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final"/>
    <config xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:config:1.0" model="model1" name="name1">
        <layers inherit="false">
            <include name="layer3"/>
        </layers>
        <!-- the rest of the configuration -->
    </config>
</installation>
----

`inherit="false"` attribute indicates to the provisioning mechanism to not inherit any layers for the configuration from any of the feature-packs included up to that point. The resulting `model1:name1` configuration will include only `layer3` (plus its dependencies) even if `prod1` included more layers into `model1:name1`.

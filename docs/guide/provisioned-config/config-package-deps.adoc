### Configuration package dependencies

`config` elements may include feature-pack package dependencies. So that when a configuration is included into the installation, the relevant packages required by the configuration are automatically included as well. Package dependencies are configured using the same elements described in <<_feature_package_dependencies,the feature package dependencies>>. E.g.

[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:feature-pack:2.0"
              location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final">
  <config model="modelA">
    <packages>
     <package name="p1"/>
     <package name="p2" optional="true"/>
    </packages>
  </config>
</feature-pack>
----

Now every configuration of `modelA` will depend on and bring into the installation the specified packages.

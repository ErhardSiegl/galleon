#### Anonymous configurations

Anonymous configurations are associated with neither name nor model. E.g.

[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:feature-pack:2.0"
              location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0">
  <config>
    <!-- config body -->
  </config>
</feature-pack>
----

Which means anonymous configurations have no identity. They cannot be customized and they are not merged.

IMPORTANT: Each anonymous configuration is a standalone configuration.

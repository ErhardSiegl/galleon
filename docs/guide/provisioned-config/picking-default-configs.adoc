### Picking default configs into the installation

There are two scenarios when including a configuration could be necessary:

. when the configuration was excluded with `<exclude model="_model_name_"/>`;

. when inhertance of the default configurations was disabled with `<default-configs inherit="false">`.

The first one of course assumes that the configuration is associated with both name and model. It could look like this:
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs>
        <exclude model="model1"/>
        <include name="config1" model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

The example above excludes all the `model1` configurations except `config1`.

[[disable-def-configs]]Here is an example for the second scenario
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs inherit="false">
        <include name="config1"/>
        <include name="config1" model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

The example above picks only `config1` and `model1:config1` from all the default configurations to be included into the distribution.

It is also possible to include configurations of a specific model, e.g.
[source,xml]
----
<feature-pack location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final">
    <default-configs inherit="false">
        <include model="model1"/>
    </default-configs>
</feature-pack>
----

In this case, all the default configurations of `model1` will be included into the distribution.

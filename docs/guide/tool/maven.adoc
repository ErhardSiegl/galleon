## CLI tool Maven configuration
By default the following maven repositories are used to retrieve FP. 

* _http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/_
* _http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/_

The cli allows you to 
change the path to the local repository and add/remove remote maven repositories.

### Relying on maven settings
In order to makes the cli to use a maven settings file call: _mvn set-settings-file <path to settings xml file>_
In order to remove the reference to the settings file call: _mvn set-settings-file_ +

NB: Advanced mirroring (eg: _external:*_) is not supported. + 
NB: Any other cli maven configuration items will be overridden when a settings xml file is set. +
NB: If no local repository is set in settings file, the local repository (default or configured) is used.

### Adding new remote repositories
Use the following command to add new remote repositories: +
_mvn add-repository --name=myrepo --url=http://foorepo [--release-update-policy=<policy>] [--snapshot-update-policy=<policy>] [--type=<type>]_ +

NB: The type, release update policy and snapshot update policy are optional and have default values.

### Default Repository policies
Daily update for releases, never update for snapshots. +
Warn if checksum differs.

Update polices can be changed by calling: +
_mvn set-release-update-policy <always|daily|interval:|never>_ +
_mvn set-snapshot-update-policy <always|daily|interval:|never>_

NB: Calling one of these commands without any argument will reset to the default value.

### Advanced maven configuration
Proxy, authentication, mirroring and offline are only supported when setting a maven xml settings file.

### Local repository
By default the local maven repository is located in _<user.home>/.m2/repository_. 
You can change this directory by using the command: _mvn set-local-repository <path to your local repository directory>_ +
In order to reset to the default local maven repository call: _mvn set-local-repository_

### Display maven configuration
Call command: _mvn info_

### Impact on Universe
Any change made to the maven configuration makes the CLI to re-resolve universe(s). 
This means that stream resolution stays in sync with maven configuration.

### Fetching feature-packs
When remote repositories are set, feature-packs are automatically downloaded at install time. 
You can download feature-pack explicitly to the local repository by using the 
command: _mvn fetch-feature-pack <stream name> [--verbose]_

### Maven tracing
When enabling "verbose" at installation and provisioning time, any artifact retrieved 
from a remote repository is advertised in the console. This also
applies when fetching explicitly feature-packs.
